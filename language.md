Abstract—The Chinese language is becoming dominant in the 
world due to the economic and political rise of China recently. 
The purpose of this paper is to help Arabic children at an 
early age, from five to ten years, to learn Chinese language, via 
a mobile application design developed to teach the basics of 
Chinese vocabulary, including numbers, colors, foods, clothes, 
events, and also common phrases, with quizzes. To improve 
the learning experience, this application link for learning the 
Chinese language and culture is configured so that every 
component (vocabulary or phrases) reflects the information 
about Chinese culture. A questionnaire was distributed to 
explore the expected benefits of using such applications. In 
addition, the presented prototype helped to identify some 
significant requirements to consider when designing similar 
mobile applications. In conclusion, this study highlights the 
importance of introducing cultural components when 
designing mobile applications for teaching a foreign language, 
which has vast opportunities to develop the children’s 
personality and introduce them to universal values.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent theoretical developments have revealed that 
learning a foreign language is one of the most significant 
factors of communication and exchanging cultures. In 
modern societies, it plays a fundamental role in economic 
growth and strengthening relations between communities. 
Those who learn languages play an essential role in 
promoting the cultural and spiritual heritage of society. 
Children at an early age from 5 to 10 years old have many 
individual and psychological characteristics that enable 
them to gain language and develop practical communication 
skills; that is why the choice of this group to teaching 
language was the most attention of developed countries [1].
Much research has shown that learning a new language 
is a useful tool to develop many new skills that contribute to 
forming the child's character, enhancing communication 
capabilities, and making relationships, reasoning skills, and 
raising awareness]2[ . It is a fact that a child, during the first 
ten years of life, can learn more than he learns through the 
rest of his life [1]. Due to this fact, the best time to teach 
children a new language is from birth to the age of ten years 
[2]. 
A research study consisting of a public opinion survey 
conducted on 15 May 2017 from the National Center to the
King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue ]3[ indicated 
that 91% of children in Saudi Arabia are using smart 
devices, 43% of these children are under five years old, and 
the average hours of children’s daily use of mobile devices 
was four hours. Accordingly, the proposed application 
focuses on children above five years due to their ability to 
learn faster and retaining the absorbed knowledge for a 
longer time compared to adults.
Nowadays, societies seek to form a multicultural 
community achieved through openness to other cultures, 
and one of the most critical factors is teaching languages. 
For this reason, this work aims to develop a mobile 
application to assist Chinese language learning focusing on 
children under ten years old, and this application is 
developed in response to the requirements of the cultural 
renaissance of Saudi society these days. The purpose is to 
develop an application to make learning Chinese easier for 
children who have never studied Chinese at all. That will be 
achieved by using smartphones to make learning Chinese 
vocabulary easier, helping in creating an attractive learning 
environment, and enhancing learning effectiveness by 
assisting children in understanding the culture behind 
Chinese in an effortless manner.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
The next subsections provide instructions on how to

A. Learning Chinese Language
Learning Chinese is considered a challenging practice 
for non-native Chinese speakers. The Chinese language 
consists of over 80,000 characters [4], not like the Korean 
and Japanese languages. Sometimes the words in Chinese 
language may be composed of one or more characters, or it 
could be a word that makes spelling skills very complicated. 
Also, Chinese has both traditional and simplified characters, 
depending on the diverse regions of China [4]. This 
presents the greatest challenges of the Chinese language for 
learners and educators such as tones, character recognition, 
writing, and the lack of consistency between the character 
script sound. There are difficulties in the similarities of like￾sounding words as well as some words with the same 
syllables and the same tones, but having a different 
meaning and different character representations, that make 
it so difficult to remember [5] Based on the Chinese 
language learning theories, the rapidly growing use of 
technology such as mobile learning plays an essential role 
in reducing efforts in the learning process [6].
B. Mobile Learning
Mobile learning or m-learning comes with several 
concepts. Some researchers state that m-learning allows

students to learn while using mobile devices without 
considering the place and time constraints [7]. Numerous 
research studies were conducted to measure the 
effectiveness of a mobile application in the learning process, 
especially in terms of language teaching. One such example 
was using the WhatsApp application to perform an 
experiment in National Research Tomsk Polytechnic 
University to determine the impact of mobile learning in 
teaching a foreign language for students who had a pre￾intermediate English level. Based on the final exam, the 
students who were under the experimental group were 
better than the control group. This finding can be enhanced 
through mobile learning, which allows the student to 
practice while doing the task on WhatsApp [8].
Previous studies emphasized the effectiveness of mobile 
application in teaching a foreign language. For example, a 
holographic mobile-based app is designed to help non￾English speaking children. Because pronunciation is one of 
the most challenging skills, this application focus on using 
native voices plus images and interactions; it interacts with 
those three-dimensional robots with children. The 
experiment was conducted on seventy children who were 
divided into three groups. One group was assigned to use 
this application with 3D game technology. This group had 
better performance results compared to the other two 
groups [9]. 
Another application used a speech recognition engine to 
teach English vocabulary; through this application, the user 
can quickly identify incorrect pronunciation and gave the 
user the right pronunciation [10]. Word Learning-CET6 
[11] is another example that teaches Chinese college 
students 1274 English words; this application has an 
"unknown words command," which is help for the user to 
repeat difficult words and eliminating the words that are 
already known by the user. The results showed that the 
experiment has a positive effect on the group who use this 
application.
III. RELATED WORK
The next list shows related applications that address the 
main features offered by Chinese language learning 
applications:
• Chinese Characters First Steps [5] created by the 
developers at the university with several features, 
including mobility, progressive learning, integrating 
writing, listening, reading, vocabulary building, 
gaming, and personalized learning. In this app, 
every activity consists of only ten matching 
questions. It had positive reviews for being suitable 
for beginners, due to its user interface and its role in 
improving different skills. The negative reviews 
came from the users who had technical problems 
with sound, tracing, or payment. The overall result 
of the study had positive impressions from the users 
of the application
• Hanzi Swype Learning Application [12] helps 
both non-Chinese and native Chinese learners to 
learn and practice writing Chinese characters in the 
correct order. The goal of this application is to make 
learning more fun and more comfortable for 
students. The application is useful in detecting any 
possible errors when the user writes a character in 
the wrong direction. Order-based errors are also 
covered in this application, as Chinese characters 
may consist of one or more strokes. Therefore, 
learners have to know the sequence of the stroke. 
Technically, the application seems handy by asking 
for easy to obtain requirements to run it. It requires 
Android OS version 2 and above. The hardware 
should have at least 2GB of memory and the 
processor is 1.5GHz or above.
• Game Chinese Language Learning [7] with 
Gamification and Using Mnemonic Method an 
application was developed, and designed an 
application based on gamification, which depends 
on using games in a non-game context and the 
mnemonic method, using peg word, keyword, and 
loci methods to help students learn Chinese in an 
enjoyable environment. The application has three 
types of games. Each type uses a score-based 
method to measure the acquired knowledge of 
players, making the game more interesting. The 
authors examined thirty students of primary school 
from the fourth to sixth grades in the West Jakarta 
area. This study presented positive results, and the 
post-test degree increased compared to the pre-test 
after playing the game. Using a learning tool like the 
authors’ game gives a better result than traditional 
learning.
• Chinese Character Learning [13] is a mobile 
application to learn Chinese as a second language in 
a bilingual primary school using the iPod. It was 
developed in 2010 for university foreign exchange 
students to learn some basic sets of Chinese 
characters. The learning games module was 
designed as the strategy to intrinsically motivate 
students to spend more time learning; the greatest 
advantage of this application is it can be used to 
implement self-directed individual learning, game￾based learning, and group learning, providing 
functionality for studying and practicing writing, 
listening, and speaking a basic set of Chinese.
• Chinese Panda [4] is a mobile application 
compatible with IOS and Android designed in 
English and multi-languages to assist children to 
learn Chinese characters and vocabulary while 
focusing on four language skills – writing, reading, 
listening, and speaking – that were presented in 
colorful images and stories. One distinct feature of 
the application provides collaborative games that 
allow users to challenge their friends in social 
networking such as Facebook and Twitter. Then, the 
score will be counted. This application would be 
considered as an interactive environment to be a 
more attractive, easy way to remember, and a self￾learning resource.

IV. APPLICATION LIMITATIONS
A study was conducted by Harrer (2015) to investigate 
the sociocultural component in the content of teaching 
foreign languages to pre-school children. It highlighted 
limitations on creating the curricula and applications aimed 
to teach foreign languages to children which do not 
consider the sociocultural component of the content. This is 
significant because the primary knowledge about other 
countries will become a bridge to recognizing the world of 
other cultures, which leads to mutual understanding, and 
increased tolerance to differences which exist among 
nations [1].
The claimed limitation in Harrer’s study is considered 
as the gap that led to propose the question of this study. 
Therefore, this paper aims to enhance teaching foreign 
languages and focus on Chinese by developing a mobile 
application that identifies the basic vocabulary of Chinese 
language such as numbers, foods, clothing, color, and 
events, and also including sociocultural content shown as 
vocabulary with pictures about their foods, clothing, and 
special events. 
V. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The main goal of this study is to design and develop a 
mobile application which facilitates learning Chinese for 
children by presenting the chosen vocabulary material and 
background knowledge in the sociocultural context. This 
app targets children in early age from five to ten years of 
age to master the following knowledge and skills.
1. Knowledge
1.1 The essential vocabularies.
1.2 Cultural knowledge of some top sights, 
customs, and traditions of China.
2. Skills
2.1 To use the formulas of speech etiquette in the 
situations of greeting people (saying hello, 
saying goodbye), congratulations, etc.
2.2 Learn how to ask the common questions, such 
as “How are you?”; “What is your name?”; 
“How much?”, etc. and how to respond 
appropriately.
VI. IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM AND REQUIREMENT 
ANALYSIS
One of the common problems for creating mobile 
applications for foreign language is the problem of defining 
a sociocultural component of the content of teaching [1]. 
Research in this sphere showed that the sociocultural 
component of the content of teaching a foreign language to 
children has not yet been taken into account [1]. So, data 
collection and analyses phases aim to (a) determine the 
feasibility of using mobile applications to teach foreign 
languages for Saudi and Arabic children; (b) Determine the 
best practical method, which defines sociocultural 
components in the content of teaching; (c) Identify the 
impact of merging the Chinese learning process with its 
culture; (d) Assess the importance of learning Chinese by 
Saudi and Arabic children in the future; and (e) Gather 
information about user needs to better identifying system 
requirements.
VII. QUESTIONNAIRE
This study used in an online questionnaire and was 
distributed to reach the most significant number of 
participants. There are three hundred seventy-one 
participants that responded to the survey. The first question 
discussed aimed to explore an effective way to learn a 
foreign language. Almost 55.5% preferred the traditional 
way through the school. 18.1% were in favor with the 
remote learning through mobile application, while 10.5% 
chose via the website. Other responses provided other 
methods, such as “watch movies, coexistence, and practice 
conversation with individuals of the same language.”
On the other hand, parents were asked: “Have your 
children used a mobile application to learn a foreign 
language before?” The total number of responses were three 
hundred thirty-nine, where 50.1% of them admitted the use 
of a mobile phone by their children to learn a foreign 
language. When parents were asked to evaluate the benefits 
to their child from those applications, the results were 
average, as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, around 76% of 
parents supported the idea of allowing their children to gain 
benefits from a mobile application in learning a foreign 
language in their spare time, but 23.7% said the opposite. 
Figure 1. Evaluation of children from using mobile application
It is essential to consider the views of participants to 
support this project based on their requirements. The 
question “What do you think is the most important to learn 
about the Chinese language?” was asked. Learning 
vocabulary was the highest choice by 63.9%, while 27% 
think it is more significant to learn grammar. Other 
responses were received with different views, as shown in 
Figure 2. Also, the positive impacts of integrating learning 
the Chinese language with its culture in the learning process 
was agreed by 73.6%, while 26.1% did not agree. 
Furthermore, 79.7% would like to use the proposed 
application of this project to learn Chinese, while 20.3% 
would not. Then, the survey asked them, “Would you also 
encourage your children to practice it to learn Chinese 
language and culture?” Most responses were in favor, at 
80.3%. Many participants (61.7%) believed that Chinese 
language would be useful and widespread in the future due

VIII. APPLICATION DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
A. Design Methodology
The application is applying two approaches to design 
and presenting the proposed application:
• Sociocultural approach [1], where every component 
(vocabulary or phrases) reflects the information 
about Chinese culture. For example, clothing and 
food about the most popular holidays and traditions 
connected with their celebrations. 
• Classifications approach [1], where different 
components that contain sociocultural content (food, 
clothing, events, national symbols, etc.) have been 
classified. 
After considering the fields of children’s cognitive 
interests and presented in both Arabic and Chinese 
forms, the following principles were used to choose the 
sociocultural content:
• Rule of typical usage, where vocabulary and phrases 
are reasonable for the children of this age.
• Rule of attractiveness, because image memory 
prevails at the children at an early age, as well as to 
attract the kids' attention to teaching foreign 
languages. The app was develop based on using 
visual aids (such as pictures and symbols).
With that said, the proposed application aimed to cover 
the following requirements:

D. Development Methodology
1) Application architecture
Application architecture is the highest level of 
representation that states the scope of an application. 
However, Figure 7 illustrates how the system is going to 
work when a user sends a request from the app to the web 
server, which then send queries to the database to return the 
requested information, and then the web server sends a 
response to the end-user application.
2) Workflow diagram 
A visual representation of the processes in the proposed 
application and how the workflow moves between them is

presented in the workflow diagram, as shown in Figure 8. It 
shows the home page when the user starts an application. 
From the home page, a user has multiple options, including 
categories, common phrases, and quizzes. When the user 
clicks on the categories button, six additional categories 
will display (numbers, colors, foods, family, clothes, and 
events) and then the user selects a specific picture to start 
learning; also, the application allows a user to learn 
common phrases when choosing the common phrases 
button. The user could track his improvement and 
knowledge if he selects the quizzes button to start a quiz, 
and the application gives the user a result indicating if his 
chosen answer was correct or wrong. Figure 7. Application architecture

IX. DISCUSSION AND RESEARCH LIMITATIONS 
To support foreigners in learning Chinese characters 
more efficiently, this study discussed the design and 
development of a mobile application for children at an early 
age (five to ten years). The proposed solution was able to 
collect and analyze context information and could present 
helpful suggestions . The questionnaire result shows that 
users can benefit, and they are willing to use this kind of 
mobile application. The proposed application aims to 
improves the learning experience for children by presenting 
the chosen vocabulary material and background knowledge 
in the sociocultural context, which is merging the Chinese 
learning process with its culture. The prototype helped to 
identify the main features that meet users' requirements. For 
example, users can practice the language by writing the 
word and listening to the sound to check the correct 
pronunciation. Users can also take short quizzes to examine 
11

their knowledge. One of the greatest limitations of this 
study was in the testing phase. Due to time constraints, the 
researchers were not able to test the application with a large 
number of participants. The results of conducting the 
experiment using this mobile app may be affected by 
conducting the usability testing on a larger group that would 
be assessed further in future studies.
X. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The rapid development of modern technology using 
mobile applications in language learning assisted in 
providing a new experience of the mobile-based learning 
environment. In this paper, a mobile application is designed 
for Arabic speakers to make Chinese vocabulary learning 
more efficient and interesting. This application targets 
children in the acquisition of vocabulary background and 
knowledge of some sights, customs, and traditions of China. 
Different components of audio, pictures, and flashcards that 
contain sociocultural content (information about food, 
clothing, events, national symbols, etc.) were presented. 
There are still some points that need to be improved in the 
future. First, offering more features, such as activating the 
voice recognition and also dividing the app into multiple 
levels based on the progress level of the child. Second, 
improve the design of content to include short videos 
containing stories of the most famous heroes and traditional 
events of Chinese culture in both Arabic and Chinese 
languages.
