Content: Professor Dino will have a Xmas exchange gifts party. I have not decided whether I'll in Boston or not. If I'll go to the party, I need to buy something between $10 and $20 with an exchange label if possible. Then wrap it well and bring it to the party. Also, I need to bring my own drawing of a stray puppy. There will be a reward for the best drawing.
